 * The font was generated with EA FontEditor. Please contact ELECTRONIC ASSEMBLY
 * for more details (techik@lcd-module.de)
 *
 * TAB 6/22/2015 - Modified for mbed compiler
 *
 * The array starts with a 8 byte header:
 *  1st Byte: 'F' first 2 bytes are always FV
 *  2nd Byte: 'V' for FONT VERTICAL
 *  3rd Byte: First code to define
 *  4th Byte: Last  code to define
 *  5th Byte: Width of character in dots
 *  6th Byte: Height of character in dots
 *  7th Byte: Height of character in bytes
 *  8th Byte: Bytes needed for each character (1..255)
 *            or 0 for big fonts calculate WidthInDots * HeightInBytes
 * After that font data will follow
